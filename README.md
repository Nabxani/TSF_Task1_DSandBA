# TSF_Task1_DSandBA
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.(Prediction using supervised ML). Programming Language:- Python

This code does the following:

1.It loads the data from the provided url using pandas.
2.It plots the data to visualize the relationship between the study hours and percentage score using matplotlib.
3.It splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.
4.It creates a linear regression model and fits it to the training data using LinearRegression class.
5.It uses the model to make predictions on the testing data.
6.It plots the test data and the predictions to visualize how well the model is performing using matplotlib.

The model is a simple linear regression model, which assumes that there is a linear relationship between the number of hours of study and the percentage score.
